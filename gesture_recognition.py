# In this  module:
# We import the mediapipe library and set up the Hands and drawing_utils modules for hand detection and drawing landmarks.
# The GestureRecognizer class is created to encapsulate gesture recognition logic.
# The recognize_gesture method takes a frame (image) as input, processes it using MediaPipe Hands, and checks for hand landmarks.
# Inside the recognize_gesture method, you should implement your gesture recognition logic based on the hand landmarks. For example, you can use the positions of fingers and the palm to detect gestures like play/pause, volume control, etc.
# If a gesture is recognized, return the corresponding action (e.g., "play_pause", "volume_up", "volume_down"). If no gesture is recognized, return None.
